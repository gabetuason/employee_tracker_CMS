## Description

A command-line application to manage a company's employee database. Allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). The db file contains a schema.sql and seeds.sql, which contains department, role and employee values.

Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) and Node.js v16. Also inside is a Package.json for metadata and dependencies, which allow package managers like `npm init` to install. See installation and usage for proper use of the application. This application is built for the purpose of managing a company's employee database using SQL queries (located in the index.js).
